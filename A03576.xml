            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe points are called the Poles of the Globe. In the Poles this is to be noted, they are but two, they are right oppoſite one to another, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant from the Centre of the Globe. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde that the Globes (which we vſe) repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parte of the worlde, therfore we call theſe foreſaid Poles, the Poles of the worlde and ſpeaking eyther ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Poles, or of the Poles of the worlde, wee haue relation onely to thoſe pointes vppon which the Globe mooueth, whereof the one is tearmed the North, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the South pole. Laſt of all from the one Pole to the other wee muſt imagine a line to bee drawen through the Centre of the Globe, the which right line is called the axeltree of the Globe, which in the reuolution of the Globe neuer mooueth but ſtandeth ſtill. Thus much generally concerning thoſe thinges which are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Globe, ſo farre foorth as it is ſimplie called by that name. Let vs now proceede to the diuiſion thereof.
<pb facs="tcp:6572:6"/>The ſurface of the Globe, as wee haue hetherto ſpoken of it, is to be vnderſtood as a blancke hauing nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in it, yet fit to receiue any inſcription: therefore according to the inſcription of the Globe wee diuide it two ſeuerall wayes: ſo that the Globe is ſaide to be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Celeſtiall, or Terreſtriall. The celeſtiall Globe is that which contayneth in the conuenitie thereof certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the heauen, and the fixed ſtarres, with their Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall appertinences.

               <p>By your definition I perceaue that your whole diſcourſe ſhalbe either of the circles belonging to the Globe, or elſe of the Starres with their Aſtronomical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertenences as you call them. But before wee enter into the diſcourſe of theſe matters, I muſt craue a worde or two with you, concerning the particularities of your defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that by comparing it with the thing defined, and with the thing ſignified by the Globe, which is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, I may the better vnderſtand the matter. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that you ſay that the Globe is rounde, would you haue me by theſe wordes vnderſtande the Heauen to be ſo?</p>

               <p>Yea that you muſt, &amp; to confute that fonde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who affirmed the Heauen to be flat, there are ſundry argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts alleadged by the Learned, whereof ſome are probable, the other neceſſary, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are theſe: Firſt it hath pleaſed God in the forme of the heauen to ſet forth a reſemblance of his eternitie, that as in this figure, ſo in him there is neither beginning not ending. 2 For ſo much as the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende all corruptible things, &amp; without it is neither time nor place, therefore it hath receiued a ſphericall forme,
<pb facs="tcp:6572:6"/>which of all Iſoperimetrall figures is moſt capacious, and fitteſt to containe. 3. If the Heauens were not rounde, but three or foure ſquare, or of ſome ſuch like figure, that monſtruous abſurditie which nature doth ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, that is to ſay an emptineſſe muſt bee graunted. 4. This roundnes being denied, it muſt needs follow, that whereſoeuer, and of what ſorte ſoeuer the ſituation of the earth were, the diſtance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not be the ſame, ſo that the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tities of the ſame Starres &amp; their diſtances would be vnequall to thoſe that dwell in any one place of the earth.</p>

               <p>And by your leaue Sir it ſeemeth ſo: who is he that hath not ſeene the full Moone to riſe as bigge as a buſhell, the which not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding being mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted higher ſeemeth nothing ſo great. Againe in a fayre day, if wee looke rounde about vs, toward each part of the Heauen, doth it not ſeeme further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs neare vnto the ground, than ouer our heads? So that if we ſhould make our eyes iudges of the roundenes of Heauen, wee can not auerre it to be ſo, becauſe the Starres appeare in ſeuerall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and each parte of Heauen ſeemeth not to be of an equall diſtance from vs.</p>

               <p>In deed it is ſomewhat which you ſay but moſt eaſily anſwered, euen by a familiar example. A man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his booke ſeeth the quantity of each letter, &amp; which way ſo euer he turneth himſelfe keeping the booke in one diſtance from his ſight the letters appeare of the ſame quantitie, but if he put on his ſpectacles he conceaueth the letter to be greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, becauſe the viſible forme thereof is inlarged by that meanes. The like muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the Starres, namely that which way ſoeuer they mooue they would appeare of the ſame magnitude,
<pb facs="tcp:6572:7"/>were it not that neare vnto the earth, when the Sunne is readie to ſet, there is a dampe or miſte which is vnto our ſight as the ſpectacles are, whereby the viſible forme of the Starres ſeene is ſo inlarged and diſperſed, that our ſight cannot comprehende them in their proper Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The like vnto this is to be perceaued in the water, which cauſeth any thing caſt into it to ſeeme greater, than it would appeare in the ſame diſtaunce lying on the bare grounde. As for the ſeconde obiection which you make, you muſt vnderſtand this, that the ſight is not an immediate iudge of a diſtance aſſigned, but gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it by meanes, that is by the interpoſition of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of men or houſes, or trees, or hilles, or ſome other ſuch like thinge betwixt the eye and the thing ſeene. Which thinges interpoſed if they bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wee affirme the thing ſeene to be farre off, becauſe reaſon telleth vs that they cannot be contained in a ſmall ſpace: contrarywiſe if they bee fewe wee iudge the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce to be the leſſer. Hereupon it commeth to paſſe that our eye running along by the grounde and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo many houſen, churches, hilles, and trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and the heauen, wee iudge and affirme it to be farre from vs: but for ſomuch as in looking vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde heauen, there is nothing to be ſeene directly in our ſight, except a cloude or two which (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers affirme) cannot be aboue three miles or there aboutes diſtant from the earth, therefore wee thinke that parte of heauen to be nearer: ſo that the argument taken from the equall apparent magnitude of the ſtarres cannot bee but true, and inferreth the roundeneſſe of the heauen. The. 5. argument is ſet from the motion of the ſtarres, which is circular. 6. Againe the Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb facs="tcp:6572:7"/>figure is fitteſt to mooue, and therefore moſte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tte for the heauen, whoſe motion is continuall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion. 7. Moreouer by the forme of the partes namely the Starres, wee inferre the forme of the whole. 8. Alſo this ſtandeth with reaſon, that the moſt perfect body ſhould haue the moſt perfect forme, and therefore the heauen beyng ſo pure and perfect that the Philoſophers wanting a name for the ſubiect mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof it is made, haue called it a Quinteſſence, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>equireth alſo the moſt perfect forme which is Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and rounde, as may appeare by all the workes of God, where in this roundeneſſe is eſpecially to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. 9. Laſt of all we may take an argument from our Aſtronomicall inſtruments which are moſt fitte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rounde and are deriued from a circle. Thus much for the forme and figure of heauen.</p>

               <p>You ſay then that the heauen is moſt perfectly rounde: and not onelie that, but you will haue it alſo to bee accounted a Solide bodie. By the worde Solide we commonly vnderſtand that bodie which beyng made of ſome maſsie matter is not hollow within, but whole and intire through out. Muſt I conceaue the heauen to be ſo?</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Names are beſt taken from familiar thinges, wherewith wee are beſt acquainted: For ſomuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the effectes of the Sunne in the courſe of the yeare are greatlie correſpondent ſo certayne properties founde in theſe common things, therefore the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers thought it good to intitle the ſignes by their names. As for example: wee know the Ramme to be of nature hotte and drie, carrying his chiefe credite in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, ſuch is the effect of the Sunne in this ſigne. Therein he beginneth to make ſhewe of his heat, &amp; with his heat he inferreth a drineſſe, as may be ſeene by the Marche winds, which then begin to blow whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sunne entreth
<pb facs="tcp:6572:26"/>into this ſigne. The ſecond ſigne is the Bull, whoſe force is more than the Rammes, and his complection is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke, euen ſo is the heate of the Sunne augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholike humor beginneth to abounde. The thirde ſigne is Gemini the twinnes, which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the doubled force of the Sunne, and the naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of each liuing thing vnto copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that time of the yeare. The fourth ſigne which is the Crabbe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the returne of the Sunne, and his going backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde as it were: for the Sunne after he is come to the head of this ſigne declineth no more from the Equator, but returneth againe nearer and nearer to that circle and here vpon the head of this ſigne is called the Tropicall point, and that tropicke which toucheth the Eclipticke in that point, is called the tropicke of Cancer. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer forſomuch as the Lion of all other creatures is the ſtrongeſt, and the hotteſt, and neuer freed of an ague, therefore the ſift ſigne is called the Lion, to ſignifie the mighty ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that is in the heat of the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, &amp; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our bodies vnto feuers at that time of the yeare. The ſixte ſigne is the Virgin, which ſignifieth that the Sunne in that ſigne bringeth forth no new thing, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth euery thing forwarde to a ripeneſſe: euen as the Virgin of her ſelfe is barren, but groweth euery day riper and riper, as the courſe of nature doth require. The Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance which is the ſeuenth ſigne doth import the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and equall paſſing of the day and night, which are then of one length, when the Sunne entreth into this ſigne, ſo that the head of this ſigne &amp; Aries are the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall points. The eight ſigne, which is the Scorpion, ſignifieth that euen as, if you take not heede of the faire countenaunce of that beaſt, you may be priuilie, and at
<pb facs="tcp:6572:26"/>vnawares ſmitten with his ſtinge, ſo alſo if you take not heede to your ſelfe, at that time when the Sunne poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this ſigne, his faire ſhew in the morning may ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue you, that you may be ouertaken with a colde not thought on before night: Likewiſe the pearcing colde of the froſt and ſnowe falling in the moneth of Nouember is reſembled by the arrowe of the Archer which is the ninth ſigne. The tenth ſigne is the Goate: the Sunne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto this ſigne declineth no farther from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but beginneth then to clime, and mount alofte in reſpect of vs, that dwell to the Northwarde of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whereupon that tropicall circle which toucheth the Eclipticke line in the head of Capricorne, is called the tropicke of Capricorne: This mounting and climing of the Sunne, the Aſtronomers haue thought good to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe by the figure of this beaſt, which of all other of that binde climeth moſt high, and is by nature Melancholicke anſweareable to the ſeaſon of the yeare.

               <p>The qualitie of the aſpects is eyther certaine or vncertaine. The certaine is eyther good or badde bothe of them are either perfect or meane. The perfect good aſpect is the trine becauſe the ſignes, which beholde one an other in that aſpect, agree in bothe their qualities: as ♈. and ♑. are both hot and drie: as ♉. and ♍. are both drie and colde, &amp;c. The meane good aſpect is the Sextile, becauſe the ſignes placed in that aſpect do in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie partly agree, and partly diſagree: as ♈. and ♊. agree in heate, but the one is drie the other moiſte, yet are they not directly oppoſite. The badde aſpects are the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature and the oppoſition. The vncertaine aſpect is the coniunction for it is ſometimes good, ſometimes badde, according to the Planets which meete together. Out of the conſideration of theſe aſpects ariſeth that diſorderly

They did not count their dayes from one to 30 or 31. as wee doe, but they diuided their moneth into three ſeuerall partes, which were Kalends, Nones, and Ides, according as the three foreſayd letters doe import. The firſt day of euery moneth was called the Kalends, and therefore the letter K. is applied vnto it throughout the horizon. The other dayes of the Kalends, were they more, or leſſe, did not ſucceede in the ſame moneth, but did goe before in the former moneth, and were counted backward. As for example, the Kalends of Ianuarie did not follow the firſt of Ianuarie, but went before in the moneth of December in this manner: the laſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember which is the 31. day, they called the day before the Kalends: the 30. of December was the third of the Kalends of Ianuarie, the 29. of December was the fourth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>It is ſo. Moreouer, if you note with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree any Starre commeth to the Meridian, ſeeke out the oppoſite degree, when the Sunne poſſeſſeth that degree,
<pb facs="tcp:6572:51"/>then at midnight you ſhall ſee the ſtarre in the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian: but wee cannot from hence infer the eleuation of the pole, becauſe euery where be the pole higher or lower, the ſtarres continuallie come to the meridian with the ſelfeſame degree of the eclipticke. Heere is occaſion offred to deliuer vnto you the coſmicall, achro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and helicall riſing and ſetting of the ſignes and ſtarres, which are not to be neglected of young ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, eſpecially ſuch as are conuerſant in reading of the Poets, becauſe in many places they can hardlie be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, without the knowledge of theſe things, Coſmicall riſing and ſetting of the ſtarres generally taken, is their aſcending and deſcending at any houre of the day whatſoeuer. Likewiſe, wee define general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Achronicall riſing and ſetting of the ſignes and ſtarres to be their aſcending and deſcending in the night. But properlie they are applied to that time onlie at which the Sunne doth ariſe or ſet. Therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which the Sunne poſſeſſeth being applied to the Eaſt ſide of the horizon, the ſigne or ſtarres which are then on the Eaſt ſide of the horizon with the Sunne, are ſaid to ariſe Coſmicallie, and they which at the ſame time are in the Weſt ſide of the horizon, are ſaid to ſet coſmicallie. Furthermore, the degree which the Sunne poſſeſſeth, being brought to the Weſt ſide of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, the ſigne or ſtarres that are on that ſide with the ſaid degree, doe ſet Achronicallie (that is by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the edge of the night) and they on the other ſide ariſe achronicallie. Whereby this appeareth, that what ſigne or ſtarres ſoeuer ariſe coſmicallie, the ſame doe ſet achronicallie, and contrarywiſe. Likewiſe what ſtarre or ſigne ſoeuer riſeth achronicallie, the ſame doe
<pb facs="tcp:6572:51"/>ſet coſmicallie, and contrarywiſe. The helicall riſing of the ſtarres is their appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce after they haue bin hidden by the beames of the ſunne. The helicall ſetting of the ſtarres is the hiding by the beames of the Sunne. For this you muſt note, that the Sunne mouing from the Weſt to the Eaſt, doth by litle and litle gather vpon the ſtarres which are Eaſtward from him, and comming neare vnto them within ſome 15. degrees, litle more or leſſe, according to the quantitie of the ſtarres, by his brightnes he obſcureth their light, and then are they ſaid to ſet helicallie. Afterwards the Sunne keeping on his courſe, leaueth the ſtarres to be ſeene toward the Weſt, then are they ſaid to riſe helicallie. By the Globe you ſhall gather the helicall riſing and ſetting thus, turne the degree which the Sunne poſſeſſeth to the Eaſt ſide of the horizon, the ſtarres which are alitle aboue it, are thoſe which are riſen helicallie, for the Sunne hath left them to be ſeen before his riſing. Againe, turne the degree which the Sun poſſeſſeth to the Weſt ſide of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, the ſtarres which are alitle aboue it, are thoſe which are ready to ſet helicallie, for the Sunne will come vpon them from the Weſt. The next thing to be noted, is the amplitude of the Sunne or ſtarres.</p>

               <p>The amplitude is to be conſider at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant time of the riſing and ſetting of the Sun or ſtarres, and not elſe. The amplitude is the diſtance of the Sunne or ſtarres from the true Eaſt or Weſt meaſured by the arcke of the horizon. Therefore you muſt bring the place of the Sun (that is the degree of the ecliptick which the Sun poſſeſſeth) or the ſtarre aſſigned to the Eaſt or Weſt ſide of the horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according as the time requireth,
<pb facs="tcp:6572:52"/>then marke how many degrees of the Horizon are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained betweene the Sunne, or the Starre, and the true Eaſt or Weſt point of the Horizon, for thoſe degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> expreſſe the amplitude. Amplitude is either North or South. North amplitude is the arcke of the Horizon counted from the true Eaſt or Weſt Northward. South amplitude is to the Southward. The ſeafaring men kepe account as I told you before by the points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, but it is better to obſerue the amplitude by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The Sunne or Starres vnder the equator haue no amplitude, becauſe that circle alwayes riſeth and ſetteth full Eaſt and Weſt: for the other points of heauen this is generall, that thoſe which haue equall declination, haue equall amplitude, be it to the North, or to the Southward. In a right Sphere the declination and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of the Sunne and Starres is of one quantitie, ſo that knowing the one, I knowe the other: therefore if at any time in trauailing, wee finde the declination and amplitude of the Sunne or Starres to agree together, it is a certaine ſigne that wee are then vnder the equator, and our Zenith is iuſt in that circle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Then may I inferre this alſo, that for ſo much as the meridian of a right Sphere, &amp; the Horizon may be counted as one, if the diſtance of the Sunne or Starres from one Zenith be equall vnto their declination, wee are iuſt vnder the equinoctiall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay true: in any oblique Sphere the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and amplitude of the Sunne or Starres doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes differ, for the amplitude doth exceede the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet is it neuer more than 90. degrees. Where the pole is eleuated (as you may perceiue by the Globe) 66. d. 30. min. the amplitude of the Sunne in the tropicall
<pb facs="tcp:6572:52"/>points, is 90. degrees. Where the pole is in our Zenith, there is no account made of the amplitude, becauſe there is neither riſing nor ſetting of the ſtarres. The vſe of the amplitude is in the finding of the eleuation of the pole. Each ſeuerall ſtarre in each ſeuerall eleuation, hath a peculiar amplitude, ſo alſo haue the ſeuerall degrees of the eclipticke, whoſe declination doth differ. Therefore the amplitude of the Sunne or ſtarre being knowen, if you bring them to the horizon, and rayſe the pole of the Globe, or depreſſe it, vntill the ſtarre or Sunne come to his iuſt amplitude, the pole ſhall haue his true ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>Here you muſt note this, that for ſo much as the ſunne is the efficient cauſe of the day, therefore to know how long he continueth aboue the horizon is to know the length of the day, which is found in ſeuerall manners. Firſt thus. Bring the degree which the ſunne poſſeſſeth to the Eaſt ſide of the horizon, then rectify the index, ſetting if vpon 12. a clock in the houre circle. Turn the globe about vntill the ſaid degree come to the Weſt ſide of the Horizon: the hours (which the index run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ouer) expreſſe the continuance of the ſunne aboue the Horizon: in like maner may you finde how long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtarre continueth aboue the Horizon.</p>

But in an oblique Sphere (if the Sunne or ſtarres be not in the equinoctiall) the day is either longer or ſhorter than 12. houres. If the Sunne or ſtarres decline toward the pole eleuated, their continuance is longer, if from that pole their continuance is ſhorter aboue the horizon than 12. houres, by the difference of aſcenſion twiſe taken as I finde before.</p>

               <p>Many things both pleaſant, and profitable in Aſtronomie, as the eleuation of the pole. If the day be continuallie but 12. houres long, then are wee preciſely vnder the equator. If the day be 6. moneths long, then are wee directlie vnder the pole. The other eleuations are found out thus. Diuide the length of the day into two equall partes, and conuert the houres into degrees, as if the day be 16. houres long, the halfe thereof is 8. houres, which containe 120. d. From the head of Aries count theſe degrees in the equator to the Weſt ſide of the Horizon, and ſet faſt the laſt degree vnder the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, ſo that it ſtirre not from it: then in the equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall colure count the declination of the Sunne for the day propounded either vpward or downeward from the equator, according as the place of the ſigne requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Laſt of all, rayſe or let fall the pole of the Globe vntill the degree of declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth touch the Horizon, ſo ſhall the pole haue his iuſt eleuation, the like may be done by any fixed ſtarre. The ſecond thing to be noted in knowing the length of the day, is the time of the Sunnes riſing or ſetting, for if the length of the artificiall day be diuided into two partes, the one declareth the houre of his ſetting, the other being ſubducted from 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The like may be done concerning the riſing and ſetting of the ſtarres. The third thing is the length of the night: for the length of the day being ſubducted from 24. houres, yeeldeth the length of the night.</p>

Each part of heauen thus diuided is called an houſe. The beginning of them is in the Eaſt, and from thence the reſt are accounted vnder the horizon to the nether part of the meridian, and from thence vpward to the Weſt, and ſo by the South ſide of the meridian to the Eaſt againe, for ſo the reuolution of the heauen requireth. The inſtrument whereby the houſen are found out, is that halfe circle which we commonly call the circle of poſition wherof I ſpake before.

The houre being knowen by the ſhining of the Sunne, the 4. cardinall points doe ſtraightway offer themſelues, whereof that which is in the Eaſt is called the firſt houſe, that which is vnder the horizon in the meridian is the fourth houſe, that which is in the Weſt is the ſeuenth houſe, and that in the South part of the meridian is the tenth houſe. Theſe being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeuerally according as you ſee in the figure follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, from the point of the equator, which is vnder the meridian, you ſhall count 30. degrees toward the Eaſt, ouer the thirtith degree bring the circle of poſition, and note what point of the eclipticke it croſſeth, for that is
<pb facs="tcp:6572:58"/>the beginning of the eleuenth houſe, and the degree op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite vnto that degree of the eclipticke is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fift houſe. Againe, from the point of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, which is vnder the meridian, you ſhall count 60. degrees toward the Eaſt, and ouer the ſaid 60. degree bring the circle of poſition, and note what point of the eclipticke it lighteth vpon, for that is the beginning of the twelfth houſe, and the oppoſite degree of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke vnder the Horizon is the beginning of the ſixt houſe. The beginning of the ninth and eight houſe are found out in the ſame manner on the Weſt ſide of the Globe, as the eleueth and twelfth houſe were found out on the Eaſt ſide. The beginning of the ſecond houſe is the degree oppoſite to the eight houſe, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree oppoſite to the ninth houſe is the beginning of the third houſe.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>The Sunne being in the meridian, the heigth of the pole may be found out thus. Rectifie the Globe preciſely in the open aire, not regarding the eleuation of the pole of the Globe at his due heigth. If the gnomon caſt a ſhaddow, the pole of the Globe is either higher or lower than it ſhould be, and therefore muſt it be rayſed, or let fall.</p>

               <p>If the ſhaddow runne toward the pole eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you muſt rayſe the pole of the Globe, if it runne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pole toward the equator, you muſt let the pole fall.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, for if you remember it, I told you, that when the ſpherical gnomon caſteth no ſhadow, then do wee finde not onely the houre of the day, but alſo the coaſting of the Sunne, that is, the point of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe vpon which hee ſhineth: Compare therefore your Compſſe with the Globe, and you ſhall eaſily finde, whether it doth varie yea or no, and how much the variation is, ſo that the Globe bee rectified preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it ought to be: for if the Sunne ſhine vppon the ſame point of your Compaſſe, vpon which the Globe ſignified him to bee, then hath it not variation at all, but if they differ, their difference will expreſſe their variation. Thus much concerning thoſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may bee performed on the Globe by the ſhining of the Sunne, and the Sphericall Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Let vs now come to thoſe propoſitions, which require a certaine ſuppoſition, or the granting of ſome one thing or another, and may bee performed without the ſunne ſhining: and thus, for example. The houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen to finde the height that the Sunne ſhall haue, at that ſame houre. Rectifye your index, turne the Globe either to Eaſt, or Weſt ſide of the Horizon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the houre aſſigned doth require, vntill the index fall vpon the ſayd houre, then faſten the Globe, and bring the quadrant of altitude ouer the place of the ſunne, the degrees of it intercepted betweene the place of the Sunne, and the Horizon, expreſſe his height at that houre.</p>

               <p>Yes, for it findeth that circle whereof it receaueth his name, that is the circle of poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is but a great circle drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one interſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the horizon and meridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto the other, through the centre of ſome ſtar, or any point els aſſigned in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diuiding the ſphere into 2. peeces. By it in erecting of the 12. houſen, we find what notable ſtarres, or what planets are in any of the houſen. The diſtance of any circle of poſition from the meridian is found thus. The circle of poſition being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the horizon vnto any point aſſigned in the globe, moue the quadrant of altitude (fixed to the Zenith) to the eaſt or weſt point of the horizon as occaſion requireth: the degrees of the quadrant contained between the ſaid circle of poſition &amp; the meridian expreſſe the quantity of the angle which it maketh: each circle of poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of halfe an horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in that reſpect it hath ſingular vſe in aſtronomical &amp; geographical matters, as

               <p>You ſee that the foure leſſer circles of the globe diuide the whole ſurface thereof into 5. partes. Euery one of them is called a Zone.</p>

               <p>It ſignifieth among the Grecians a gyrdle, or a ſwadling band, and therefore it is fitly applyed vnto theſe portions of the globe, becauſe they in their figure repreſent after a manner ſuch a thing. Of the Zones ſome are encloſed with one onely limit ſome with two: thoſe which are incloſed with one only limit, namely with the circle arcticke, and antarcticke are the two Zones which lie about each pole, which becauſe of their diſtance from the eclipticke, and place of the ſunne are called cold. Not that there is ether heate or colde in heauen, but becauſe they which dwell on earth vnder that circuit of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="tcp:6572:64"/>feele not the Sunne ſo forceable in his heat by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his obliquitie, as others doe. The other 2. Zones are limited on each ſide: That which is in the middeſt, being limited on the one ſide with the tropick of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, on the other ſide with the tropicke of Capricorne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his courſe continually within it doth greatlie heate that part of the earth which is ſubiect vnto it. The other two being nether too neare the Sunne, nor too farre of are called temperate, becauſe they are nether ſo hot as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>one, nor ſo cold as the other: that which is to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is limitted with the circle arcticke, &amp; the tropick, of Cancer, the other to the Southward is encloſed with the circle antarcticke, and the tropicke of Capricorne: The breadth of each cold zone is 47. degrees: the breadth of the burning Zone is as much: each temperate Zone hath 43. degrees in breadth. As they are deſcribed on the celeſtiall globe, they expreſſe vnto vs what ſtarres are encloſed within each ſeuerall Zone, which are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Thus much concerning the vſe of the celeſtiall Globe, wherein if I ſeeme to haue bin ouerlong, I doe therefore craue pardon, becauſe I haue witten it for the behoofe of our countrie men, who being not throughly ſeen in the Latine tongue might from hence gather that in ſome meaſure, which might further their knowledge, and ſatiſfy their deſire in theſe kinde of matters.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſo: but herein mee thinketh the terreſtriall globe is faulty, becauſe it doth not repreſent the true forme of the earth, as the celeſtiall globe doth reſemble the heauen, for the earth is not round.</p>

Their arguments are ſet, not only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proportion, but alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the riſing &amp; ſetting of the ſtarres, &amp; the raiſing &amp; depreſſion of the poles. Item beſides the eclipſe of the moone &amp; the natural courſe of the water, that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to our ſight in going from, or comming neere the ſhore, is an euident token of the foreſayd roundnes.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>But for all theſe arguments I ſay, that the globe doth not repreſent the iuſt forme of the earth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ful of hilles &amp; dales doth greatly diſagree from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect round. yea my ſight alſo witneſſeth ſuch a thing, for which way ſoeuer I looke, both the water and the earth for the moſt part ſeemeth playne.</p>

                  <p>It is is ſomewhat <hi>Philomathes</hi> which you ſay, but there are diuers reaſons which moued the Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers in ſetting forth the terreſtrial globe, to do that which they haue done, that is, to make it rounde. Firſt becauſe it was not neceſſary to make theſe hilles &amp; dales, it was ſufficient to expreſſe their place, &amp; to ſay the truth it was vnpoſſible to ſet them forth as they are indeede. Secondly, the earth in regarde of the heauen doth not ſeeme otherwiſe than rounde: as you may perceaue by the ſhadow thereof, which in the eclipſe is moſt ſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, &amp; round: thirdly, theſe hilles and dales in regarde of the whole earth, are but as a mole, or wart vppon a mans bodie, or the ſmall pimples on an orange. And as for the playnes which I ſee, bee it either on the water or land, it aryſeth of the huge circuit of the earth, which is ſo great, that each parte thereof which wee ſee, cannot but ſeeme vnto our ſight to be a right liue.</p>

                  <p>They haue the ſame poles, the ſame axletree, the ſame imaginarie circle.

                  <p>So they doe: but they are therefore expreſſed in this, becauſe the globe of the earth and water being contained within the heauen, and being in reſpect the centre thereof, wee may hereby gather what part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſubiect to any part of the heauen.

                  <p>Not ſo, for as you ſee by the Globe, each circle of longitude maketh 2. ſeuerall interſections with the equator the one on the one ſide, the other on the other ſide right oppoſite: whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe places which are vnder one and the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian may differ 180. degrees in longitude.

                  <p>Bring ether of the two places vnto the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if the other be to the Eaſtwaad thereof. I ſay that that place which is vnder the meridian is preuented in the

Contrariwiſe if one of the 2. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being brought to the meridian, the other be found on the Weſt ſide thereof, then doth the place vnder the meridian preuent the other, as for example. London &amp; Mexico being compared together, London being placed vnder the meridian, Mexico is on the Weſt ſide thereof, therefore London preuenteth Mexico: whereby I may conclude, that it is 6. a clocke in the morning at London before it be 6. a clocke at Mexico. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>If you conuert the difference of longitude into houres &amp; partes of houres as is conuenient, you ſhal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily find out what the time is, wherein the one place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth the other.

                  <p>Let me throughly conferre with you about this matter: how do you define latitude in resſpect of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall Globe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>It is the diſtance of any point aſſigned in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall Globe from the equator, limited by the degrees of a great circle drawen from the poles of the World through the point aſſigned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Then by your wordes I gather this, that for ſo much as the beginning of latitude is in the equinoctiall, what ſo euer is vnder that circle, can haue no latitude. Alſo the latitude may be counted toward ether of the poles, ſo that it is ether Northerne or Southerne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the pole is, toward which the place bendeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the equator. But when you ſay that the latitude muſt be accounted from the equinoctiall to the place, doe you not meane the Zenith?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, you muſt alwaies ſo vnderſtand it: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the word latitude be applyed to the terreſtriall Globe, yet is it ſought out by the circles of heauen, and commonly being demaunded what the latitude is, wee anſwere that it is the diſtance of our Zenith from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, notwithſtanding it is ſufficient ſpeaking of the terreſtriall Globe, to ſay that the latitude is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted from the equator to the place aſſigned.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>What great circle is it in which the latitude muſt be accounted?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>It is that great circle of longitude which is drawen from the poles of the world through the place aſſigned, but becauſe it were an infinite worke to drawe a great
<pb facs="tcp:6572:72"/>circle through euery place, therefore in ſeeking out the latitude wee make the meridian of the Globe to ſerue our turnes in this manner. Bring the place aſſigned to the meridian of the Globe, the degrees of the meridian intercepted betweene the equator &amp; the place aſſigned, expreſſe the latitude of it: ſo I ſay, that the latitude of London is 51. degrees, 30. min. becauſe London being brought vnto the meridian falleth vnderneath that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and minute, and is ſo farre diſtant from the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>

                  <p>Is the latitude of London 51. degrees. 30. min? I tooke that to be the eleuation of the pole at London.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>So it is alſo, for the eleuation of the pole and latitude are all one in number: for this is vſually to bee ſeene vpon the Globe, that ſo far as any place is diſtant from the equator, ſo high is the pole from the horizon: Therefore when you deſire to raiſe the pole of your globe vnto his due height, ſeeke out the latitude of the place aſſigned, according to that raiſe the pole aboue the horizon.</p>

                  <p>You ſay well, for if the declination of the ſunne, &amp; the latitude of the place ether are, or may be equall, then wil the Sun paſſe by the Zenith, but if the latitude be greater than the declination of the Sunne may be, the Sunne neuer commeth to the Zenith. Againe when the Sunne poſſeſſeth any degree of the eclipticke hauing a declination equall vnto the latitude of the place aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that day will he croſſe the verticall point of the ſaid place.</p>

                  <p>Seeke out in the meridian the declination of the Sunne, and there make a marke, ſeke out alſo the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the place aſſigned, there alſo make a marke, the degrees of the meridian intercepted betweene the two markes expreſſe the diſtance of the Sunne from the Zenith: So ſhall you finde the Sunne in Cancer to be diſtant from our Zenith here at London 28. degrees, but being in Capricorne, hee is diſtant from it 75. degrees. If you deſire to know this by rule, the rule is: the place aſſigned being without the Tropickes, and the Sunne declining toward the pole eleuated, the declination of the Sunne taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the latitude geueth his diſtance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Zenith, as the Sunne declining northward twenty degrees, twelue minutes, is diſtant from our Zenith at London thirtie degrees, eighteene minutes. If the Sun decline from the pole eleuated, his declination added to the latitude, giueth his elongation from the Zenith. Item, if his place aſſigned bee within the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, his declination toward the pole cleuated, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared
<pb facs="tcp:6572:82"/>with his latitude, and the leſſer: being ſubducted from the greater, the remainder geueth his diſtance from the Zenith: Otherwiſe if the Sunne decline from the pole eleuated, the totall ſumme made of the declination, and the latitude affordeth the foreſayd diſtance. If the place aſſigned be vnder the equator the declination of the Sun is equal to his diſtance from the Zenith according as you may perceaue by the Globe.</p>

                  <p>We are hereby certifyed of the ſeuerall ſeaſons of the yeare in each ſeuerall place. Summer is cauſed by the acceſſe of the Sun vnto our Zenith: Winter, by his receſſe from the ſame. Hereby therefore wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what people haue two winters and two Summers: alſo who haue but one winter and one Summer: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as dwell vnder the tropicks, and from thence toward the poles haue but one, becauſe the Sunne falleth from their Zenith, &amp; commeth toward them but once in a yeare, they which dwell within the tropicke haue two, becauſe the Sunne croſſeth their Zenith twiſe, and falleth twiſe alſo from it, once to the North, and agayne to the Southward. But betweene their Summers and Winters there is not an equall diſtance vnto any of them, thoſe onely excepted which liue vnder the equator: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iuſt in the middeſt of the Sunnes proper motion haue the ſeuerall ſeaſons of their yeare diſtinguiſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in common ſence. The other haue their ſeaſons diuided vnequally, as they that dwell in the 20. d. 12. m. to the Northward haue from their firſt Summer to the ſecond two moneths, but from the ſecond to the firſt Summer following in the next yeare, they haue ten mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
<pb facs="tcp:6572:82"/>namely all that time, wherein the Sunne is going from Leo to Gemini: Furthermore this is generally to bee noted by the eclipticke, that they which dwell on ſeuerall ſides of the equator haue neuer the ſame ſeaſons falling out at the ſame time: for if it be Winter to them that dwell to the Northward of the line, it is Summer to them that dwell to the Southward, and contrariwiſe.</p>

                  <p>Not ſo, as many as are vnder or without the tropick toward the pole haue their Winter and Summer at one time, namely, when the Sunne entreth the hed of Cancer, but they that dwel from the equator to the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke haue their Winter and Summer onely then, when the Sunne is furtheſt from their Zenith, or els croſſeth it. As they that doe dwell vnder the equator haue their Summers when the Sunne entreth into Aries and Libra, and then croſſeth their Zenith But their Winters fall out when he commeth to the tropicall points, and is furtheſt diſtant from their Zenith: they that dwell 11. d. 30. m. to the Northward of the line, haue their Summers when the Sunne entreth into Taurus &amp; Virgo, but their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in his entrance into the tropickes, for that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to them that dwel within the tropickes, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer their Summers alter their times, their Winters alwaies keepe their appointed dayes, which are thoſe, wherein the Sunne entreth the tropicall pointes.</p>

                  <p>You ſay true: this is the onely difference, that here wee muſt haue an eie to the latitude, becauſe the true place of any citie or to wne vppon the terreſtriall Globe is found rather by it than by the cleuation of the

By that which I taught you euen now, this alſo may be gathered, that if the Sunne being in any certayne ſigne aſſigned do riſe an houre two or three ether ſooner or later vnto others, than vnto mee, I ſay I may know what people they are as for example, if the ſunne in Cancer riſe vnto me at 4. a clocke, and to another at 3. or 2. a clocke in the morning or to another at 5. clocke: how farre do they differ in latitude from me ether to the northward or to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</p>

                  <p>The chiefeſt conſideration, which is to bee had in this matter is in what halfe of the Zodiacke the ſunne is. If the ſunne be in the northren ſignes, they which haue the longer day haue the pole higher eleuated, than they which haue a ſhorter, but the ſun poſſeſſing the ſouthern ſignes, they which haue the longeſt day haue a leſſer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, if you remember this you cannot erre, ſo that the ſituation of the places be both toward one pole, or one of them vnder the equator.</p>

                  <p>Let me try if I my ſelfe can hammer out this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: the Sunne in Cancer riſeth to me at London at 4. a clocke and 45. minutes in the morning how far do they dwell from me ether Northward or Southward, that is to ſay otherwiſe, how do they differ in latitude from me, to whom being in the ſame ſigne he riſeth at 3. a clocke 45. minutes. Firſt I conclude this, that they dwell to the Northward, becauſe their day is longer, the Sunne poſſeſſing the Northren ſignes: then doe I raiſe the pole according as the fatitude of London doth require, and afterwardes bring the interſection of the firſt circle of
